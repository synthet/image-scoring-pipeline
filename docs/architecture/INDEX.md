# Architecture — index

Structural documentation for **image-scoring-pipeline**. For contracts and stable reference
material see [../technical/INDEX.md](../technical/INDEX.md); for the source-of-truth map see
[../CANONICAL_SOURCES.md](../CANONICAL_SOURCES.md).

## System

| Page | Purpose |

| [pipeline/phase-preconditions.md](pipeline/phase-preconditions.md) | Gating and run/skip decisions. |
| [pipeline/phases/INDEX.md](pipeline/phases/INDEX.md) | Per-phase deep references. |
| [pipeline/run-lifecycle.md](pipeline/run-lifecycle.md) | Submit through completion, as sequence diagrams. |
| [pipeline/control-plane.md](pipeline/control-plane.md) | Dispatcher, orchestrator, planner, auto-drive, heal sweeps. |
| [pipeline/persistence.md](pipeline/persistence.md) | Phase tables, columns, constraints. |
| [pipeline/terminology-map.md](pipeline/terminology-map.md) | Cross-naming traversal table. |
| [pipeline/localization-rollout.md](pipeline/localization-rollout.md) | Proposed eight-stage rollout for early localization and reusable region artifacts. |
| [pipeline-architecture.md](pipeline-architecture.md) | Short summary; routes into the set above. |

## Data layer

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
