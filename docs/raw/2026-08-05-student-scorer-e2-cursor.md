## Arc (what this conversation covered)

Multi-session student-scorer research program on **image-scoring-pipeline**, continuing from an approved “Full Student Scorer Research Program” and later E0/E1 / E2 resume plans.

### Already complete before this window

- Phase 0–2 scaffold: audit, frozen manifest, evaluators, shadow-only student modules (not enabled in fusion).
- **E0/E1** MobileNet embedding baselines → **FAIL** all fidelity gates (val general Spearman ~0.56–0.60). Documented in `docs/research/STUDENT_SCORER_RESULTS.md`.
- E2 pipeline code landed: `render_p0.py`, `image_dataset.py`, `torch_losses.py`, real `train_image_model.py` loop, tests, protocol notes, autonomous-run contract.

### P0 render (completed this arc)

- Resume fix: `ThreadPoolExecutor` (12 workers), atomic index flush every 500, orphans **re-decoded** (not `skipped_existing`).
- Full cache finished after WSL kills; flush held at 44k mid-restart.
- **Final `render_summary.json`:**
  - `n_index` 66,485 · ok 66,473 · missing_source 9 · error 3
  - `exiftool:JpgFromRaw` 35,935 · `rawpy_half` 30,538 · no `skipped_existing`
  - Cache ~**2.7 GB** under `~/.cache/student_scorer/…/p0_512/`
  - Wall ~75 min this leg; ~3 h cumulative vs 3 h render budget
- Human checkpoint docs: `docs/research/STUDENT_SCORER_E2_CHECKPOINT.md`, GitHub **#323**, `docs/log.md` entry.

### E2 train (in progress at session end)

- Smoke (`--epochs 2 --limit 500`) completed; tiny val (~61 rows); gates failed (not gate-readable by design).
- Full E2 seed-42 relaunched after a WSL restart killed an earlier run that had reached **epoch 6** (`val_loss` ~0.00131).
- **At pause (`2026-08-05T21:46`):** train **still running** (PID ~1215); `best.pt` epoch **1**, val masked teacher loss **0.00150**; GPU active. `report.json` still from smoke until full run finishes.
- Pending when train ends: overwrite `runs/E2_s42/report.json`, append RESULTS + log with named gate pass/fail.

## Key decisions locked

| Topic | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Orphan JPEGs | Re-render for true `resolved_method` |
| Supervision | Checkpoint after render (later resumed past that gate) |
| Head order | `meta["teachers"]` (alphabetical), not `DEFAULT_TEACHERS` |
| Gate composites | **Derived** from teacher heads; direct aux heads reported for E0/E1 comparability |
| Frozen contract | Do **not** fix `musiq_version: "unknown"` (would invalidate protocol) |
| Out of scope | E3–E6, rank/human, calibration, export_checkpoint, shadow enable, re-split |

## Resume checklist

1. Confirm train alive or finished: `pgrep -af train_image_model`; read `runs/E2_s42/report.json` for full (non-limit) run.
2. If dead mid-run: relaunch `.agent/scratch/run_e2_full_only.sh` (nohup / setsid; LF line endings; `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`).
3. Append E2 row to `STUDENT_SCORER_RESULTS.md` + `docs/log.md` (record gate **fail as fail**).
4. Update issue #323 and optional `STUDENT_SCORER_E2_CHECKPOINT.md`.
5. Do **not** enable shadow / change fusion without a new human decision.
