# Implementation Summary - January 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation work completed on the Image Scoring project TODO items in January 2025.

## Completed Features

### 1. RAW Preview: Pass File Path via Gradio State ✅

**Problem**: JavaScript was using fragile DOM scraping to find file paths from JSON components.

**Solution**: 
- Added hidden textbox (`gallery_selected_path`) to store selected file path in Gradio state
- Updated `display_details_wrapper()` to return the file path
- Modified JavaScript (`libraw-viewer.js`) to read from Gradio element ID instead of DOM parsing

**Files Modified**:
- `webui.py` - Added `gallery_selected_path` textbox, updated event handlers
- `static/js/libraw-viewer.js` - Updated path extraction logic

**Benefits**:
- More reliable and maintainable
- Removes dependency on DOM structure
- Consistent with other tabs (Stacks, Culling) which already use this pattern

---

### 2. Model Performance Benchmarking ✅

**Problem**: No visibility into how long model inference takes.

**Solution**:
- Added `time` import and timing around `predict_quality()` calls in `run_all_models()`
- Stores `inference_time_seconds` for each model in results
- Adds performance summary with total and average inference times
- Displays timing in UI model score labels (e.g., "SPAQ (0.234s)")

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/python/run_all_musiq_models.py` - Added timing tracking
- `webui.py` - Updated `display_details()` to extract and display timing from scores_json

**Benefits**:
- Performance monitoring and optimization insights
- Users can see which models are fastest/slowest
- Helps identify bottlenecks

---

### 3. Culling: Session Resume UI ✅

**Problem**: Users couldn't resume previous culling sessions to review or continue work.

**Solution**:
- Added `resume_culling_session()` function to load session data
- Enhanced `get_active_sessions()` to show detailed session stats
- Added dropdown and resume button in Session Management accordion
- Populates picks gallery when resuming a session
- Auto-refreshes dropdown choices on page load

**Files Modified**:
- `webui.py` - Added resume UI components and handler function
- `modules/db.py` - Used existing `get_active_culling_sessions()` and `get_session_picks()`

**Benefits**:
- Users can continue working on previous sessions
- Review previous culling decisions
- Better workflow continuity

---

### 4. Advanced Export Options ✅

**Problem**: Export always included all columns and all images, no filtering options.

**Solution**:
- Added `_build_export_where_clause()` helper function for reusable filter logic
- Updated `export_db_to_csv()` and `export_db_to_excel()` to accept filter parameters
- Added comprehensive UI for column selection (grouped by category) and filtering
- Supports filtering by: rating, label, keyword, score thresholds, date range, folder path

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/db.py` - Added helper function and updated export functions
- `webui.py` - Added advanced export options UI and updated export handler

**Benefits**:
- Export only needed columns (reduces file size)
- Filter before export (faster, more focused exports)
- Better control over export content
- More efficient data analysis workflows

---

## Implementation Details

### Code Quality

All implementations follow project conventions:
- ✅ Thread-safe database operations
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Logging where appropriate
- ✅ Consistent with existing patterns
- ✅ No linting errors

### Testing Status

- ✅ Code compiles and passes linting
- ⏳ Manual testing recommended for:
  - RAW preview state management
  - Export filtering accuracy
  - Session resume workflow
  - Performance timing accuracy

---

## Remaining TODO Items

### High Priority (Testing)
- Manual browser testing for RAW preview
- Lightroom Cloud integration verification

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)
- **Web Worker for RAW decode** - Less critical now that server-side endpoint exists
- **AI-Assisted Mode** - Requires significant UI/workflow redesign
- LibRaw WASM Integration
- Additional Vision-Language Models

### Low Priority (Future)
- UI themes and customization
- Export format templates
- Keyboard navigation
- Cloud processing support

---

### 5. Export Format Templates ✅

**Problem**: Users had to reconfigure export settings (columns, filters) each time they wanted to export.

**Solution**:
- Added template management functions to `config.py` (save, load, delete templates)
- Added template UI in Export section with dropdown, save, load, and delete buttons
- Templates store all export configuration (format, columns, filters)
- Templates persist in `config.json` under `export_templates` section

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/config.py` - Added template management functions
- `webui.py` - Added template UI components and event handlers

**Benefits**:
- Quick reuse of common export configurations
- Faster workflow for repeated exports
- Consistency across export sessions

---

## Statistics

- **Features Completed**: 5 major enhancements
- **Export Format Templates**: Added template system for saving/loading export configurations
- **Files Modified**: 3 core files (webui.py, modules/db.py, scripts/python/run_all_musiq_models.py, static/js/libraw-viewer.js)
- **Lines of Code**: ~500 lines added/modified
- **Time to Complete**: Single session

---

## Notes

1. All implementations are backward compatible
2. Server-side RAW preview endpoint was added by user (not in original TODO)
3. Session resume leverages existing database infrastructure
4. Export filtering reuses existing gallery filter logic
5. Performance benchmarking integrates seamlessly with existing scoring pipeline

---

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Test new features with real workflows
2. **Documentation**: Update user-facing documentation if needed
3. **Optimization**: Review performance timing data for optimization opportunities
4. **Future Work**: Consider AI-Assisted Mode design and implementation plan
