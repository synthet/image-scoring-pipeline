# Cascade benchmark (#408, spec 03 AC-16)

Frames: 339 of the #377 cohort; labels from `labels.csv` (owner). Presence only: a frame counts as detected when the arm returns at least one box. Wilson 95% intervals. `agree@t` keeps a YOLO box only when COCO also sees an animal at t, and otherwise falls back to COCO at t, so its presence equals `coco@t`.
