# Unfinished Business & TODO Evaluation (2026-03-14)

## Assumptions & Limits

- This analysis is based on static TODO/backlog documentation, not direct execution traces.
- No runtime or system-health execution evidence was used to produce this report.
- Recommendations here are prioritization guidance and do not confirm implementation status.

## Non-Goals

- This document does not replace sprint planning artifacts.
- This document does not replace cross-repo contract governance documentation.

## Scope Reviewed

- Root consolidated backlog: `TODO.md`
- Historical project backlog: `docs/project/TODO.md`
- Embedding backlog: `docs/plans/embedding/TODO.md`
- API backlog: `docs/reference/api/TODO.md`

## Executive Summary

The project has a healthy backlog structure, but execution is blocked less by unknown technical work and more by **verification debt** and **cross-repo coordination debt**.

1. **Manual verification remains the top blocker**: RAW preview and Lightroom culling validation tasks are still open.
2. **Embedding/API work is clearly defined but unstarted**: the similarity endpoint family appears repeatedly across backlog documents, indicating priority but no implementation kickoff.
3. **Database migration initiatives are still at phase-0/phase-1 planning levels**: they are too large to remain as monolithic checklist items.
4. **Backlog duplication exists**: several items are repeated across root/project/API/embedding TODOs and should be governed from one source-of-truth list.

## Quantitative Snapshot

Checkbox count from TODO files:

- `TODO.md`: **46 open**, 2 done
- `docs/project/TODO.md`: **27 open**, 5 done
- `docs/plans/embedding/TODO.md`: **9 open**, 0 done
- `docs/reference/api/TODO.md`: **6 open**, 0 done

Interpretation:

- The root TODO is an umbrella list and correctly reflects broad, mostly-unfinished roadmap work.
- The specialized API and Embedding TODOs show **no completed items**, suggesting those tracks are queued but not actively in-flight.

## Unfinished Business by Risk Category

## 1) Immediate Validation Risk (High)

These items are likely already implemented (or partially implemented) but unproven in production-like usage:

- In-browser RAW preview manual tests (NEF/JPG/no selection/JS errors/large files)
- Lightroom Cloud import behavior for culling metadata
- Pick/reject interoperability validation

**Why this matters:** this is closest to user-facing reliability risk and can create false confidence if code exists without real-world checks.

## 2) Product Capability Gap (High)

Repeated in multiple TODO files:

- Similarity REST endpoints: `similar`, `duplicates`, `outliers`
- Streaming/progress behavior for import registration

**Why this matters:** these are foundation APIs for discovery workflows, embedding UX, and potential Electron interoperability.

## 3) Architecture Debt (Medium-High)

- Web Worker decode pipeline for RAW preview
- LibRaw WASM full decode path
- AI-assisted culling mode and face-detection prioritization

**Why this matters:** these are strategic enhancements that affect responsiveness and feature differentiation, but they are likely multi-sprint efforts.

## 4) Cross-Repository Integration Debt (Medium)

- Electron API/type updates on backend contract changes
- Integration queue/lifecycle design
- DB dual-write strategy across Python + Electron

**Why this matters:** lack of a strict integration cadence can cause backend/frontend contract drift.

## 5) Migration Program Debt (Medium)

- Firebird → PostgreSQL phased migration is still roadmap-level
- Schema refactor dual-write phases remain open

**Why this matters:** migration risk compounds over time; without vertical slices, this remains perpetually deferred.

## Evidence Mapping

- **Validation debt**
  - `TODO.md` → **High Priority** / **Testing & Verification**
    - `In-browser RAW preview tests: Select NEF → Extract Preview → Verify canvas renders`
    - `In-browser RAW preview tests: Select JPG → Verify warning message shows`
    - `In-browser RAW preview tests: No image selected → Verify error message`
    - `In-browser RAW preview tests: Verify no JS errors on page load`
    - `In-browser RAW preview tests: Large files (>50MB) → Verify progress bar works`
    - `AI culling: Import into Lightroom Cloud — verify ratings and labels apply correctly`
    - `AI culling: Test pick/reject flags — verify Lightroom recognizes culling decisions`
  - `docs/project/TODO.md` → **🔴 High Priority (Testing & Verification)**
    - `Import into Lightroom Cloud - Verify ratings and labels apply correctly`
    - `Test pick/reject flags - Verify Lightroom recognizes culling decisions`

- **API/embedding gap**
  - `TODO.md` → **High Priority** / **API & Embedding**
    - `Similarity endpoints: GET /api/similarity/similar?image_id=123, /api/similarity/duplicates, /api/similarity/outliers`
  - `TODO.md` → **Medium Priority** / **API & Contract**
    - `Streaming/progress for POST /api/import/register (currently single-request; no incremental progress)`
  - `docs/reference/api/TODO.md` → **Endpoints to Add**
    - `Similarity endpoints: /api/similarity/similar, /api/similarity/duplicates, /api/similarity/outliers`
    - `Streaming/progress for POST /api/import/register (currently single-request; no incremental progress)`
  - `docs/plans/embedding/TODO.md` → **API REST Endpoints (Priority 1)**
    - `GET /api/similarity/similar?image_id=123 — Visually similar images across folders`
    - `GET /api/similarity/duplicates?folder_path=... — Near-duplicate pairs`
    - `GET /api/similarity/outliers?folder_path=... — Low neighborhood similarity images`

- **Migration debt**
  - `TODO.md` → **Database & Migration [DB]** / **Firebird → PostgreSQL (FIREBIRD_POSTGRES_MIGRATION)**
    - `Phase 0: Schema baseline, versioned SQL migrations, migration runbook`
    - `Phase 1: Postgres + pgvector in Docker, full schema creation`
    - `Phase 2: Dual-write (Firebird primary, Postgres secondary), resumable backfill`
    - `Phase 3: Python cutover — backend-aware DB adapter, switch reads to Postgres`
    - `Phase 4: DB provider abstraction in electron/db.ts, migrate from node-firebird to Postgres client`
  - `TODO.md` → **Database & Migration [DB]** / **Schema Refactor (DB_SCHEMA_REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION)**
    - `Phase 1: IMAGE_EXIF, IMAGE_XMP tables, dual-write paths in modules/db.py`

## Recommended Prioritization (Next 2 Sprints)

## Sprint A: Close Verification Debt

1. Execute and document the 5 RAW preview manual browser tests.
2. Run Lightroom Cloud culling import validation with a deterministic test folder.
3. Capture artifacts (screenshots/logs/XMP samples) and mark each validation item done or blocked-with-reason.

**Exit criteria:** all current high-priority manual verification items transitioned from unchecked to done/blocked with reproducible notes.

## Sprint B: Start API/Embedding Core

1. Implement one end-to-end thin slice:
   - `GET /api/similarity/similar`
   - OpenAPI + API docs example updated in same PR
   - Electron notification note added (or follow-up ticket linked)
2. Add implementation stubs/feature flags for `duplicates` and `outliers` to reduce future integration friction.
3. Define performance/timeout behavior for similarity queries on large folders.

**Exit criteria:** first similarity endpoint is production-usable with synced contract docs.

## Backlog Hygiene Actions

1. Designate `TODO.md` as canonical and convert other TODO files into either:
   - pointers + subtask details, or
   - generated/derived views.
2. Add metadata fields to TODO items where possible:
   - owner
   - target milestone
   - dependency tag (`python`, `gradio`, `electron`, `db`)
   - validation status (`spec`, `implemented`, `verified`)
3. Break large migration phases into measurable deliverables (e.g., "dual-write for EXIF only", "read-switch for one endpoint").

## Suggested Decision

The best immediate business move is to treat unfinished business as **verification-first then API-foundation**:

- First, de-risk what already exists (manual validation debt).
- Second, unlock roadmap leverage with the first similarity endpoint as a contract-anchored vertical slice.

This sequence provides quick reliability gains while creating momentum on the most frequently repeated roadmap gap.

## Execution Matrix

| Work item | Primary owner role | Dependencies (`python`, `gradio`, `electron`, `db`) | Definition of done | Risk if deferred |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RAW preview manual verification | QA (with UI support) | `python`, `gradio` | Execute and document the 5 RAW preview browser checks (NEF/JPG/no selection/JS errors/large files), attach screenshots/logs, and mark each scenario pass/fail with reproducible notes. | Regressions in file handling and browser decode paths remain undetected, increasing user-facing reliability incidents. |
| Lightroom culling interoperability validation | Integration | `python`, `db` | Run deterministic Lightroom Cloud import/culling validation, verify pick/reject mappings and metadata persistence, archive representative XMP/artifacts, and record pass/fail outcomes. | Interop trust erodes; users may experience silent culling metadata mismatches during import workflows. |
| First similarity endpoint thin slice with OpenAPI/doc sync | Backend | `python`, `db`, `electron` | Ship `GET /api/similarity/similar` end-to-end, update OpenAPI spec and API docs example in same PR, and log Electron contract notification (or linked follow-up issue). | Repeated roadmap blocker remains unresolved, delaying embedding-driven discovery features and increasing contract drift risk. |
| Add stubs/feature flags for `duplicates` and `outliers` | Backend | `python`, `db`, `electron` | Add guarded route/service scaffolding with clear feature-flag defaults, smoke tests for disabled/enabled behavior, and TODO links for full implementation. | Future endpoint rollout becomes slower and riskier due to missing extension points and integration rework. |
| Define similarity performance/timeout behavior for large folders | Backend | `python`, `db` | Document and enforce timeout, pagination, and failure semantics; add benchmarks or load-test notes for representative large-folder workloads. | Production latency and timeout behavior stay unpredictable, causing poor UX and unstable client retry logic. |
| Consolidate TODO governance to canonical root list | Integration | `python` | Mark `TODO.md` as source of truth, convert secondary TODO files into pointers/derived detail pages, and remove conflicting duplicate checklist ownership. | Planning fragmentation persists; duplicated tasks continue to cause prioritization confusion and missed commitments. |
| Add TODO metadata fields (owner/milestone/dependency/validation status) | Integration | `python`, `gradio`, `electron`, `db` | Introduce metadata schema for backlog items and retrofit high-priority entries with owner, milestone, dependency tags, and validation state. | Coordination debt grows and execution tracking remains opaque across teams. |
| Split migration program into measurable deliverables | Backend | `python`, `db`, `electron` | Replace monolithic migration phases with vertical milestones (e.g., EXIF dual-write, single-endpoint read-switch) with explicit acceptance criteria. | Migration remains perpetually deferred and risk accumulates as legacy assumptions harden. |
